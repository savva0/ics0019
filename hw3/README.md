# Homework 3
The code in app.py does the following:

1. Imports data
2. Merges dataframes on common column "IATA"
and discards all rows that are not common
3. Loops through the dataframe and plots markers, lines and text on the map.
4. Saves the resulting plot to file [map.png](map.png)

## Running the code

1. Install dependencies
[MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/) (Mac)
```sh
sudo port install py-pandas py-matplotlib py-cartopy
```
2. Run the code 
```sh
./app.py
```
